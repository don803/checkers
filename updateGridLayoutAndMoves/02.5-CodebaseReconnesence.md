# Review the existing codebase

- Review the existing code base with an emphasis on determining where changes will need to be made and areas to be avoided
- Record the information you gleaned from the code base below.
  
## Findings
- CLI interaction and board rendering live in `src/Checkers.Cli/Program.cs`; current UI reads free-form move paths like `b6-a5` and uses `Position.TryParse`.
- Board headers/labels are hard-coded in `RenderBoard` (`a b c d e f g h` and `8..1`), so UI label changes should be localized there.
- Move legality is centralized in `Checkers.Core.MoveGenerator` and `GameState.GetLegalMoves`; UI should consume these rather than reimplement rules.
- `Position` currently parses/prints algebraic coordinates (`a1`..`h8`) via `TryParse`/`ToNotation`; changing these would affect core/tests, so prefer UI-only translation unless requirements explicitly demand core change.
- `Move.Path`/`Move.PathNotation` rely on `Position.ToNotation`; altering this in core would ripple into tests and error messages.
- Tests in `tests/Checkers.Tests/GameRulesTests.cs` target move generation, kinging, and win detection; they are independent of CLI UI and should not be impacted by UI-only changes.
