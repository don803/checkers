We are working in an existing codebase.  Priority is given to existing functionality unless there are requirements that mandate a change.

Smaller changes are preferred over larger changes

Not breaking existing code is more important than the changes we are making.

If needed changes would break existing code, rework code such that the breakage is avoided, or call it out as a breakange that requires approval.
    Example "Moving this html page whould break incoming links to the prior location.  Do you approve?"

The exception to no breaking changes is if the requirements call it out directly Example "Change existing Feature #1 into the new Feature #N"

Each interactions via the TUI in this session needs to be recorded at the end of file "prompts\00-requests.md" prior to the execution of the request.
